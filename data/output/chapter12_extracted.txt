After reading this chapter, you should be able to define what leadership is and identify traits of effective leaders. You will also describe behaviors that effective leaders demonstrate. The chapter specifies the contexts in which various leadership styles are effective. Additionally, it explains the concepts of transformational, transactional, charismatic, servant, and authentic leadership. Finally, you will understand connections between leading at work and ethics, technology, and cross-cultural management.

Leadership can be defined as the act of influencing others to work toward a goal, with leaders existing at all levels of an organization. Formal leaders hold a position of authority and utilize the power that comes from their position, while informal leaders influence others through personal forms of power without a formal authority. Effective leadership is distinguished by the ability to influence others without coercion, and the chapter explores how to train future leaders and improve leadership skills. The case of Stitch Fix illustrates an inclusive leadership approach, emphasizing the importance of individual contributions and decision-making within the organization. Stitch Fix aims to transform personal shopping by leveraging technology and fostering a culture where every individual can take on leadership roles.

Stitch Fix employs a diverse range of professionals, from creative designers to data scientists, and emphasizes an accessible leadership style that promotes a culture of open dialogue and creative tension. The company has implemented a 360-review process, allowing employees to gather feedback from peers and leaders regarding their engagement with the company's operational strategies. Professional development is a key focus, with a comprehensive onboarding process that introduces new employees to the company's values and strategic functions. Leadership training is ongoing throughout an employee's career, encouraging all levels to engage meaningfully with the organization and hold leaders accountable for their development. Stitch Fix prioritizes hiring individuals who are willing to embrace personal growth to support the company's ambitious vision.

The earliest approach to studying leadership focused on identifying traits that differentiate leaders from non-leaders. Researchers faced challenges in measuring personality traits, leading to varied results across different studies. By 1940, many concluded that finding definitive leadership traits was futile. However, recent advancements, particularly with the Big Five personality framework, have allowed for better identification of traits that predict leadership. Charismatic leadership is highlighted as a contemporary approach that exemplifies the trait perspective in leadership studies.

General mental ability, often referred to as "g" and synonymous with IQ, is linked to an individual's emergence as a leader. Research indicates that while high intelligence can be a predictor of leadership, its relationship to leadership effectiveness is complex, with some studies suggesting that too much intelligence may be counterproductive. Emotional intelligence (EQ) is also crucial for effective leadership, as leaders with high EQ demonstrate self-awareness, empathy, and social skills, which are essential for managing emotions and motivating others. The "Big Five" personality traits model categorizes individual characteristics that influence leadership emergence and effectiveness, including Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. These traits not only predict a person's motivation to lead but also their likelihood of being perceived as a leader by others.

Research indicates that extraversion is closely linked to leadership, as extraverts tend to be sociable, assertive, and energetic, which helps them engage effectively with their environment. Additionally, conscientiousness is another personality trait associated with leadership, as conscientious individuals are more likely to take initiative and demonstrate persistence, contributing positively to organizational performance. The role of agreeableness is also significant; agreeable leaders are often perceived as more effective due to their modesty and ability to avoid conflict. Self-esteem, while not part of the Big Five personality traits, plays a crucial role in how individuals view themselves as leaders, with higher self-esteem correlating with greater self-confidence and leadership effectiveness. Lastly, integrity is essential for leaders, as those who demonstrate honesty and moral principles are more likely to be trusted and respected within their organizations.

Despite problems in trait approaches, these findings can still be useful to managers and companies. Understanding leader traits helps organizations select the right people for positions of responsibility, but not all traits predict leadership potential equally across all circumstances. In small organizations, the traits leaders exhibit can significantly influence leadership potential, while in larger, more bureaucratic settings, other factors may play a larger role. Some traits, like bravery, may be more relevant in specific contexts, such as military leadership, rather than in business. It is crucial to identify the conditions under which different traits affect a leader's performance and emergence.

When trait researchers shifted their focus in the 1940s, they began to study leader behaviors to understand what made leaders effective. This research led to the identification of two broad categories of behaviors: task-oriented and people-oriented leader behaviors. Task-oriented leader behaviors involve structuring roles, providing instructions, and enhancing group performance, while people-oriented leader behaviors focus on showing concern for employee feelings and well-being. Researchers initially believed that these behaviors were key to effective leadership, but later studies suggested that demonstrating both types of behaviors might not necessarily guarantee leadership effectiveness. The chapter also outlines learning objectives related to understanding these behaviors and their implications for leadership.

When examining the findings on leader behaviors, it appears that both task-oriented and people-oriented behaviors can benefit organizations, albeit in different ways. Employees tend to feel more satisfied and respond positively when leaders exhibit people-oriented behaviors, while task-oriented leadership can enhance productivity. The effectiveness of a leader's decision-making style is influenced by the context, with democratic styles generally leading to higher employee satisfaction. Research indicates that laissez-faire decision-making can lead to increased conflict and ambiguity among employees, negatively impacting satisfaction and effectiveness. Additionally, managers' assumptions about human nature can shape their leadership approach, with differing views on employee motivation and work ethic influencing management strategies.

Behavioral approaches in leadership have fallen out of favor because they often overlook the environmental context in which behaviors are exhibited. Researchers initially believed that identifying specific behaviors would predict effective leadership across all situations, but this assumption proved overly simplistic. The effectiveness of leadership styles, such as task-oriented versus people-oriented behaviors, can vary significantly depending on the circumstances. Additionally, leaders can adopt different decision-making styles, including autocratic, democratic, or laissez-faire, each with its own advantages and limitations. Ultimately, understanding the conditions that influence the effectiveness of these behaviors is crucial for developing a more nuanced approach to leadership.

The text discusses the role of context in leadership, emphasizing that the effectiveness of different leadership styles can vary based on situational factors. It introduces Fiedler's contingency theory, which measures a leader's style using the Least Preferred Coworker (LPC) scale. This scale helps identify whether a leader is more task-oriented or people-oriented based on their feelings towards a least preferred coworker. The theory suggests that placing the right person in the right situation can enhance leadership effectiveness. Additionally, it outlines conditions that determine whether a situation is favorable or unfavorable for a leader's effectiveness.

Research partially supports the predictions of Fiedlerâ€™s contingency theory, indicating that there is more support for the theory's predictions regarding when low LPC leadership should be used. However, there is less support for situations where high LPC leadership is deemed more effective. Despite the theory not being fully supported, it serves as a useful framework for considering the effectiveness of task-oriented versus people-oriented leadership. The importance of context in leadership is emphasized by this theory. Another contingency approach to leadership is the Situational Leadership Theory (SLT), which suggests that leaders should adapt their styles based on their followers' development levels.

The model summarizes the level of directive and supportive behaviors that leaders may exhibit, emphasizing the need for leaders to adapt their style to the developmental stage of their employees. Employees at the earliest stages of development are viewed as highly committed but lacking in competence, necessitating a directive leadership approach. As employees gain competence, leaders should shift to a coaching style, and eventually to a delegating style for those who are both highly committed and competent. Robert House's path-goal theory of leadership posits that employees are motivated when they believe their efforts will lead to high performance and valuable rewards. The theory also outlines specific predictions about effective leader behaviors based on employee characteristics and the work environment.

Directive leaders provide specific directions to their employees, clarifying role expectations and setting schedules to reduce ambiguity in the job. Supportive leaders offer emotional support and care for employees on a personal level, which can alleviate stress in repetitive job situations. Participative leaders involve employees in decision-making, making the process more relevant to those with a high internal locus of control. Achievement-oriented leaders set goals for employees and encourage them to reach those goals, focusing on work-related tasks. The path-goal theory of leadership emphasizes the importance of adapting leadership styles based on the circumstances and the abilities of employees.

The Vroom and Yetton normative decision model is a decision-making tool designed to help leaders determine the level of employee involvement in decision-making processes. The model begins by guiding leaders through a series of questions that assess the significance of the decision, the importance of employee commitment, and the expertise available within the group. It emphasizes the need for leader expertise and the alignment of employee goals with organizational objectives to ensure effective decision-making. Additionally, the model considers the likelihood of employee acceptance of decisions made by the leader alone versus those made collaboratively. Ultimately, the approach recommends consulting employees as a group to gather insights before making a final decision.

{"text": "Vroom and Yetton's leadership decision tree illustrates which leadership styles are most effective in various situations. The decision-making process is influenced by factors such as the importance of commitment, leader expertise, likelihood of commitment, goal alignment, group expertise, and team competence. Different combinations of these factors lead to specific leadership actions, including deciding, facilitating, consulting with groups, or delegating. The tree provides a structured approach for leaders to assess their situation and choose the appropriate style. This framework helps in understanding how to adapt leadership strategies based on the context of the problem."}

The chapter discusses various decision-making styles that leaders can adopt, including making decisions alone, consulting individuals, consulting as a group, facilitating group discussions, and delegating decisions to the team. It highlights Vroom and Yetton's normative model, which suggests that certain decision-making styles are more effective depending on the situation and the leader's approach. The key takeaway emphasizes the importance of matching leadership styles to the context, noting that task-oriented leaders perform best in certain situations while people-oriented leaders excel in others. Additionally, it mentions that leaders should ensure employees feel their efforts are recognized and rewarded to enhance performance. The chapter concludes with reflective questions about the effectiveness of different leadership styles and their application in practice.

Transformational leadership theory is a relatively new concept in leadership literature, with more research conducted on it than on all contingency theories combined. This theory differentiates between transformational and transactional leaders. Transformational leaders align employee goals with their own, fostering a focus on the company's overall well-being. In contrast, transactional leaders ensure that employees exhibit the appropriate behaviors and provide resources in exchange for compliance. The section aims to explore the latest developments in leadership theories relevant to today's business environment.

Transformational leaders utilize several tools to influence employees and foster commitment to company goals. They are characterized by charisma, which instills confidence and admiration in their followers. Additionally, transformational leaders employ inspirational motivation, encouraging employees to embrace a compelling vision, and intellectual stimulation, which challenges the status quo and promotes creative thinking. In contrast, transactional leaders rely on methods such as contingent rewards and active management by exception to motivate employees and address issues. Trust is a crucial element in transformational leadership, as it fosters integrity and predictability in leader-follower relationships.

Charisma is a significant aspect of transformational leadership, but its necessity is debated. While charismatic leaders can enhance organizational performance, there are instances where their influence has negative consequences. Research indicates that a CEO's perceived charisma may not correlate with the company's actual performance. The effectiveness of a company often relies on various factors, including historical context and external circumstances. Charismatic leaders are encouraged to foster a long-term vision, engage with history, and build employee confidence while challenging the status quo.

Leader-member exchange (LMX) theory suggests that the nature of relationships between leaders and their followers is crucial for understanding how leaders influence employees. In high-quality LMX relationships, leaders and members support each other and share trust, while low-quality LMX relationships are characterized by lower levels of trust and respect. Employees in high-quality LMX relationships tend to have greater job satisfaction, motivation, and clarity regarding their roles. However, not all employees experience high-quality relationships with their leaders, which can affect their job performance and satisfaction. The dynamics of these relationships can vary based on individual factors and the specific work environment.

Employees play a crucial role in developing their relationships with supervisors by actively seeking feedback and engaging in behaviors that enhance performance. High performance alone may not suffice for a high-quality exchange; interpersonal factors like personality similarity and mutual respect are significant. The development of these relationships can vary across different corporate cultures, influencing how leaders distribute rewards. In performance-oriented cultures, the focus is on how leaders reward high performance, while in people-oriented cultures, the emphasis is on treating employees with dignity. The self-assessment tool provided helps individuals evaluate their relationship with their supervisor across various dimensions, including liking, loyalty, contribution, and professional respect.

Should you worry if you do not have a high-quality relationship with your manager? One problem in a low-quality exchange is that employees may not have access to the positive work environment available to high LMX members. Low LMX employees may feel that their situation is unfair, and even when their objective performance does not warrant it, those who have a good relationship with the leader tend to have positive performance appraisals. Managers are more likely to attribute the success of high LMX employees to their effort and abilities, while low LMX members may not receive the same recognition. LMX theory suggests that the relationships leaders form with their subordinates can significantly influence employee attitudes and behaviors, and managers should be mindful of how they cultivate these relationships to avoid favoritism and unfairness.

Having a good relationship with your manager can significantly enhance your job satisfaction and success. To improve this relationship, consider creating opportunities for interaction and seeking feedback on your performance. People tend to be drawn to those with similar traits, so identifying commonalities with your manager can be beneficial. It's important to manage impressions carefully and be a reliable employee, as trust is crucial in the manager-employee dynamic. Additionally, relationships should be nurtured from the beginning, as early interactions can set the tone for future collaboration. 

Servant leadership emphasizes the leader's role in serving the needs of others, focusing on employee development and organizational contribution. This approach prioritizes the well-being of employees, customers, and the community, fostering a moral compass in leadership.

Servant leadership is characterized by a focus on community benefits and ethical practices, as exemplified by Merck's CEO Kenneth Frazier's efforts in developing an Ebola vaccine. This leadership style overlaps with transformational leadership but emphasizes ethics, community development, and self-sacrifice. Research indicates that servant leadership positively influences employee commitment and performance, particularly in fostering a service-oriented culture. Transitioning to servant leadership can be challenging for managers accustomed to success-driven approaches, as many lack humility. Practical strategies for adopting this style include prioritizing employee needs, maintaining open communication, and engaging in community service.

Leaders must adapt to various structures and people, and the authentic leadership approach emphasizes being true to one's values. Authentic leaders are introspective, understanding their backgrounds and priorities, and they maintain personal integrity by expressing their true thoughts and behaviors. Howard Schultz, the founder of Starbucks, exemplifies authentic leadership through his commitment to employee welfare, influenced by his own experiences with medical issues. Authentic leadership fosters trust and positive relationships between leaders and employees, leading to improved satisfaction and performance. Conversely, abusive leadership involves harmful behaviors that undermine employee well-being and organizational effectiveness, resulting in significant costs for companies.

Abusive leadership is influenced by a leader's ability to manage their emotions, with research indicating that poor sleep can lead to increased abusive behaviors. This type of leadership is contagious, as new managers may adopt the styles of abusive leaders they observe, especially if those leaders are perceived as competent. Abusive leadership not only negatively impacts the targets but also harms the well-being of the managers themselves. Organizations are encouraged to implement selection and training systems that foster a culture preventing abusive behaviors. Creating an environment that discourages such leadership is essential for overall organizational health.

Popular culture and news stories often create the impression that leaders should be all-knowing and powerful, but this view is increasingly recognized as misguided. Leader humility is emerging as a key behavioral style of effective leaders, characterized by an ability to appreciate the strengths of others and an openness to feedback for improvement. Humble leaders foster a collaborative approach to teamwork, which enhances team performance and encourages employees to emulate their behaviors. However, there are boundaries to leader humility; for instance, high power distance within teams can lead to negative outcomes, as team members may expect their leaders to be all-powerful. The discussion of leadership also includes gender considerations, revealing that women and men may exhibit different leadership styles and effectiveness, with women often displaying more democratic leadership traits.

Contemporary leadership approaches include transformational leadership, leader-member exchange, servant leadership, and authentic leadership. Transformational leadership emphasizes the significance of leader charisma, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation, and individualized consideration. In contrast, the transactional leadership approach focuses on the leader's role in achieving organizational goals through exchanges with employees. The leader-member exchange (LMX) approach suggests that strong relationships between leaders and employees are crucial for effective leadership. Effective leaders must adapt their styles based on situational demands while aligning with their own values and moral compass.

Leaders play a crucial role in shaping the ethical climate within an organization by modeling ethical behavior and setting expectations for their teams. Ethical leadership is linked to job satisfaction and the willingness of employees to report issues, highlighting its importance in effective leadership. Contemporary leadership styles, such as servant and authentic leadership, emphasize the significance of ethics and the moral responsibilities leaders have towards stakeholders. The use of technology to monitor employee behavior raises concerns about privacy and autonomy, necessitating careful consideration by leaders. As organizations increasingly adopt new technologies, effective leaders must align changes with the companyâ€™s mission and foster strong relationships with employees to enhance motivation and retention.

Is leadership universal? This question arises due to the varying international activities of companies with branches in different countries. Expatriates demonstrate leadership skills in their home country, but the applicability of these skills abroad remains uncertain. Research involving 62 countries revealed that while certain leadership traits, such as trustworthiness, are universally valued, cultural differences significantly influence perceptions of effective leadership. For instance, leaders in collectivist cultures may be expected to show personal interest in employees, while in individualistic cultures, the focus may be on self-reliance and confidence.

People get their cues for ethical behaviors from leaders, indicating that leadership characteristics and style significantly influence employee behavior. Ethical leadership is associated with higher employee satisfaction and perceptions of leadership effectiveness. Contemporary leadership approaches, such as servant leadership and authentic leadership, emphasize the importance of ethics in leadership. Technological changes and new challenges, like remote work, require leaders to adapt their styles, with visionary and team-oriented approaches being preferred globally. However, traits like confidence and the willingness to sacrifice for employees can vary in cultural significance, affecting how leadership styles are perceived across different cultures.

Tim Cook took over as CEO of Apple in 2011, following Steve Jobs, amid questions about the company's future success. Unlike Jobs, Cook does not seek the spotlight and is known for being one of the most charitable CEOs, encouraging individuals to maintain a positive outlook. Under his leadership, Apple has addressed social issues, such as renewable energy initiatives and LGBTQ rights advocacy. Cook emphasizes the importance of transparency and humility in leadership, often reflecting on his mistakes and encouraging others to do the same. He believes that pursuing one's passions is essential for effective leadership and personal fulfillment.

In this chapter, we have reviewed the most influential leadership theories. Trait approaches identify the characteristics required to be perceived as a leader and to be successful in the role. Behavioral approaches classify the types of behaviors leaders demonstrate, leading to the development of contingency approaches. Recently, ethics have become an explicit focus in leadership theories, emphasizing the need for leaders to be conscious of their style and to address employee, organizational, and stakeholder needs. This requires flexibility on the part of leaders to adapt their approaches effectively.
